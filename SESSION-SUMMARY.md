### Task Status Updates
- Marked T002 (Fix process management in toolkit service) as completed
- Added new tasks:
  - T016: Standardize documentation format
  - T017: Update CHANGELOG.md with proper versioning
  - T018: Create REFACTORING.md document
  - T019: Create MIGRATIONS.md document
  - T020: Create additional SUBTASK files for complex tasks
- Updated progress on T005 (Create core documentation files) from 20% to 70%
- Updated progress on T016 (Standardize documentation format) from 20% to 50%
- Marked T017, T018, and T019 as completed

### Documentation Structure
- Ensured all documentation follows the required structure
- Standardized formatting across documentation files
- Improved cross-referencing between documentation files
- Added detailed implementation plans for complex tasks

## Next Session Plan
- Implement initial components of the unified logging system
- Begin enhancing error handling in installation scripts
- Test Docker configuration on Linux and Windows
- Create additional SUBTASK files for remaining complex tasks

## Key Decisions
- Decision to break down complex tasks into subtasks with dedicated files
- Decision to standardize all documentation following the required format
- Decision to prioritize Docker containerization completion
- Decision to implement unified logging system across all components
- Decision to enhance installation error handling with prerequisites checking

## Resources Created
- REFACTORING.md for tracking code refactoring initiatives
- MIGRATIONS.md for tracking database schema migrations
- STATUS.md for quick project status overview
- SUBTASK-T001.md for Docker Compose task details
- SUBTASK-T003.md for installation error handling details
- SUBTASK-T004.md for unified logging system details

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Consider creating subtask files for other complex tasks
- Need to validate Docker configuration on different platforms
- Consider implementing automated documentation validation
- Review and update all documentation regularly
