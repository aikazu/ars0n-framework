# REFACTORING.md - Ars0n Framework Refactoring Initiatives

This document tracks planned and ongoing refactoring initiatives for the Ars0n Framework. Each refactoring effort is documented with its goals, affected components, and progress.

## Current Refactoring Initiatives

### RF001: Toolkit Service Process Management

**Goal:** Improve stability and reliability of the toolkit service's process management system.

**Motivation:** The current process management implementation can lead to orphaned processes, especially when scans are interrupted or when the toolkit service is restarted.

**Files/Components Affected:**
- `toolkit/toolkit-service.py`
- `toolkit/wildfire.py`
- `toolkit/slowburn.py`

**Before Architecture:**
- Basic process spawning without robust tracking
- Minimal error handling for process failures
- No process kill tree implementation
- Some processes could remain running after parent process terminated

**After Architecture:**
- Comprehensive process tracking with parent-child relationships
- Process kill tree implementation to ensure all child processes are terminated
- Improved error handling for process failures
- Signal handlers to ensure cleanup on service termination

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Create a process registry to track all running processes
2. Implement kill tree functionality to terminate all child processes
3. Add signal handlers for graceful shutdown
4. Improve error handling and logging for process failures

**Progress:** 100% - Completed

**Verification Strategy:**
- Manual testing of process creation and termination
- Stress testing with multiple concurrent scans
- Verification of process cleanup after service restart

**Potential Risks:**
- Some external tools may have their own process spawning methods that bypass our tracking
- Process behavior may differ between operating systems

### RF002: Client-Side Component Structure

**Goal:** Refactor React components for better maintainability and code reuse.

**Motivation:** Current component structure has grown organically, leading to some large, monolithic components and duplicated code. A more modular approach would improve maintainability.

**Files/Components Affected:**
- `client/src/components/`
- `client/src/pages/`

**Before Architecture:**
- Large, page-focused components with mixed concerns
- Limited reuse of UI elements
- Direct API calls within components
- Minimal separation of data fetching and presentation

**After Architecture:**
- Smaller, focused components with single responsibilities
- Shared UI component library
- Centralized API service layer
- Clear separation of data fetching and presentation

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Identify common UI patterns for extraction into reusable components
2. Create a services layer for API interactions
3. Refactor existing components to use the new structure
4. Add proper PropType validation for all components

**Progress:** 0% - Planning stage

**Verification Strategy:**
- No regression in functionality
- Improved code metrics (complexity, lines of code per component)
- Consistent component API

**Potential Risks:**
- Potential for regressions during refactoring
- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing code

## Technical Debt

This section documents identified technical debt that should be addressed in future refactoring efforts.

### TD001: Error Handling Standardization

**Description:** Error handling across the application is inconsistent, with various approaches to catching, logging, and displaying errors.

**Impact:** Makes debugging difficult and creates inconsistent user experience when errors occur.

**Suggested Solution:** Create a standardized error handling approach for each layer of the application (client, server, toolkit).

**Affected Components:**
- Client-side error boundaries and API error handling
- Server-side error middleware and response formatting
- Toolkit error capturing and reporting

**Estimated Effort:** Medium

### TD002: Configuration Management

**Description:** Configuration settings are spread across multiple files and formats, making it difficult to manage and deploy with different settings.

**Impact:** Complicates deployment process and makes configuration changes error-prone.

**Suggested Solution:** Centralize configuration with environment variable support and configuration validation.

**Affected Components:**
- Server environment configuration
- Client build configuration
- Toolkit settings and API keys

**Estimated Effort:** Medium

### TD003: Inconsistent Logging

**Description:** Logging approaches vary across components, with different formats, levels, and storage mechanisms.

**Impact:** Makes troubleshooting issues across components difficult.

**Suggested Solution:** Implement a unified logging system with consistent formatting, levels, and centralized access.

**Affected Components:**
- All components that perform logging

**Estimated Effort:** Medium-to-High

### TD004: API Versioning Strategy

**Description:** Current API has no explicit versioning strategy, making it difficult to evolve the API without breaking clients.

**Impact:** Limits ability to evolve API without breaking backwards compatibility.

**Suggested Solution:** Implement explicit API versioning (URL or header-based) and documentation.

**Affected Components:**
- Server API routes
- Client API service layer

**Estimated Effort:** Medium
