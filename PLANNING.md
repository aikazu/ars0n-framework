# PLANNING.md - Ars0n Framework Improvement Plan

## Project Vision and Goals

The Ars0n Framework aims to be the leading open-source platform for automation of bug bounty hunting tasks, making security research accessible to newcomers while providing powerful tools for experienced researchers. Our improvement goals are:

1. Improve installation reliability across different environments
2. Enhance modularity to facilitate community contributions
3. Modernize the UI/UX for better user experience
4. Strengthen error handling and process management
5. Implement comprehensive documentation

## Key Milestones and Timeline

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Reliability (Weeks 1-2)
- Containerize the entire application with Docker Compose
- Refactor process management in toolkit services
- Update dependency management in all components

### Phase 2: Core Architecture Improvements (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement unified error handling system
- Enhance module integration interfaces
- Develop improved logging and monitoring

### Phase 3: Frontend and UX Enhancements (Weeks 5-6)
- Modernize React UI components
- Implement responsive design improvements
- Create better scan progress visualization

### Phase 4: Security and Performance (Weeks 7-8)
- Add authentication and authorization
- Optimize database queries and data storage
- Implement input validation and security checks

### Phase 5: Documentation and Testing (Weeks 9-10)
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Implement automated testing
- Develop user guides and tutorials

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### Performance
- Toolkit services should handle simultaneous scans without degradation
- UI should remain responsive during long-running operations
- Database queries should complete within 500ms

### Security
- No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Secure storage of API keys and sensitive information
- Input validation on all user-provided data

### Usability
- Installation should require minimal user intervention
- UI should provide clear feedback on scan progress
- Documentation should be accessible for various skill levels

### Reliability
- System should recover gracefully from errors
- Scans should be resumable after interruptions
- Data integrity should be maintained during crashes

## Development Approach and Methodology

We will follow an incremental approach, focusing on smaller modules that can be completed within a single work session. Each component will be improved independently while maintaining integration with the broader system.

Key development principles:
- Test changes in isolation before integration
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all architectural decisions and changes
- Focus on modular improvements that enhance overall stability

## Integration Points with Other Systems

### External Tools Integration
- Nuclei scanner integration
- Nmap and port scanning tools
- Cloud provider APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### Data Exchange
- API for importing/exporting scan results
- Integration with vulnerability databases
- Report generation in standard formats
