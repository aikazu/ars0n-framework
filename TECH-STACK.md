## Justification for Technology Choices

### MongoDB vs. SQL Databases
MongoDB was chosen for its flexible schema design, which is ideal for storing varied scan results with different structures. SQL databases would require complex schema design to accommodate the diverse data formats generated by security tools.

### React vs. Other Frontend Frameworks
React provides a component-based architecture that works well for building dynamic user interfaces with real-time updates, essential for displaying scan progress and results.

### Flask vs. Django for Python Service
Flask was selected for its lightweight nature and ease of integration, as the toolkit service primarily needs to provide a simple API for executing commands and returning results.

### Express vs. Other Node.js Frameworks
Express offers a minimalistic approach to building APIs, which aligns well with the needs of this application. It provides the necessary routing and middleware capabilities without unnecessary complexity.

## Compatibility Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 70+
- Edge 80+
- Safari 13+

### Operating System Compatibility
- Kali Linux 2023.4 (primary supported platform)
- Ubuntu 20.04+ (partial support)
- Windows 10+ with WSL2 (limited support)
- macOS with Docker (planned future support)

## Deprecation Warnings

| Component | Issue | Plan |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Body Parser | Partially integrated into Express | Will be removed in future versions |
| Sublist3r | Limited maintenance | Consider replacement with more active alternatives |
