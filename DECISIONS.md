# DECISIONS.md - Ars0n Framework Technical Decisions

## D001: Docker Containerization Strategy

**Decision Description**: Implement Docker containerization for the entire application stack with separate containers for each component.

**Context and Constraints**:
- Current installation process relies on direct installation in Kali Linux
- MongoDB setup is a common point of failure for users
- Cross-platform compatibility is limited
- Installation requires manual steps and troubleshooting

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Single container for entire application
2. Partial containerization (MongoDB only)
3. Virtual machine distribution
4. Keep current direct installation approach with better error handling

**Rationale**:
Multi-container approach with Docker Compose provides the best balance of isolation, scalability, and ease of use. This allows:
- Consistent environment across different host systems
- Easier troubleshooting and component replacement
- Independent scaling of components
- Simplified installation experience

**Implications and Trade-offs**:
- Adds complexity to development workflow
- Requires additional resources (Docker knowledge)
- May have performance overhead compared to direct installation
- Will require redesign of installation scripts

**Stakeholders**: Development team, users

## D002: Process Management Refactoring

**Decision Description**: Refactor the toolkit service's process management to improve stability and prevent orphaned processes.

**Context and Constraints**:
- Current implementation leaves orphaned processes
- No proper cleanup on application termination
- Difficult to stop long-running scans
- Resource leaks over time

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Process pools with dedicated management
2. Containerized execution of individual tools
3. Complete rewrite using asyncio/threading
4. Service-based architecture with separate process manager

**Rationale**:
Implement a robust process tracking and cleanup system using psutil with proper signal handling. This approach:
- Maintains compatibility with existing codebase
- Requires minimal architectural changes
- Addresses the immediate issue of orphaned processes
- Can be implemented incrementally

**Implications and Trade-offs**:
- May not solve all edge cases
- Requires careful signal handling
- Could introduce new complexity
- Will need extensive testing to verify effectiveness

**Stakeholders**: Development team, users

## D003: Error Handling Strategy

**Decision Description**: Implement a unified error handling system across all components.

**Context and Constraints**:
- Current error handling is inconsistent
- Many errors are swallowed without proper logging
- User feedback on errors is minimal
- Difficult to diagnose issues

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Component-specific error handling
2. Global error tracking service
3. Error reporting API
4. Minimal error handling with better logging

**Rationale**:
Adopt a centralized error handling strategy with standardized error types, consistent logging, and improved user feedback. This approach:
- Creates consistency across components
- Improves debuggability
- Enhances user experience during failures
- Forms foundation for future monitoring

**Implications and Trade-offs**:
- Requires changes across multiple components
- May increase code complexity initially
- Needs agreement on error taxonomy
- Requires updates to existing error handling code

**Stakeholders**: Development team, users

## D004: Authentication Implementation

**Decision Description**: Implement JWT-based authentication for API access.

**Context and Constraints**:
- Current application has no authentication
- Security tools access should be restricted
- Users need persistent sessions
- Multi-user support is desirable

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Session-based authentication
2. API keys only
3. OAuth integration
4. No authentication (current state)

**Rationale**:
JWT provides a stateless authentication mechanism that works well with the current architecture and provides sufficient security with minimal overhead. This approach:
- Enables user-specific data and permissions
- Works well with the existing Express backend
- Is compatible with the React frontend
- Requires minimal database changes

**Implications and Trade-offs**:
- Adds complexity to API calls
- Requires secure token storage
- Needs token refresh mechanism
- Will require frontend changes to handle auth state

**Stakeholders**: Development team, users

## D005: Documentation Structure

**Decision Description**: Implement a comprehensive documentation structure with specialized files.

**Context and Constraints**:
- Current documentation is limited to README
- Setup issues are common but poorly documented
- Architecture and design decisions are undocumented
- New contributors lack guidance

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Wiki-based documentation
2. Single comprehensive README
3. External documentation site
4. Code comments only

**Rationale**:
A structured set of specialized markdown documents in the repository provides the best balance of accessibility, version control, and maintainability. This approach:
- Keeps documentation with code
- Uses familiar markdown format
- Separates concerns into dedicated files
- Supports version control and PR reviews

**Implications and Trade-offs**:
- Requires ongoing maintenance
- May become outdated if not actively maintained
- Distributed nature may make navigation harder
- Needs clear organization and cross-references
