# SESSION.md - Current Work Session

## Session Identifier: Improvement Session #2 (2023-08-01)

## Session Goals
- Review existing codebase and documentation structure
- Ensure all required documentation files are in place and properly formatted
- Identify any gaps in documentation based on requirements
- Update documentation to reflect current project state

## Current Active Task References
- T001: Docker Compose setup (90% complete)
- T005: Create core documentation files (20% complete)

## Files Being Modified
- SESSION.md
- STATE.md
- TASK.md (may need updates)

## Recent Decisions and Changes
- Decision to review and update all documentation to ensure compliance with required structure
- Maintaining existing content while standardizing format

## Next Steps
- Create any missing documentation files
- Update existing files to follow the required format
- Ensure all documentation is cross-referenced properly
- Add tasks for any identified improvements

## Questions and Clarifications Needed
- Confirm if any new features are planned for implementation
- Determine priority of documentation updates vs new feature development

### Session Goals and Focus
- Continue implementation of the Docker containerization setup
- Fix process management issues in the toolkit service
- Update documentation to reflect changes

### Current Active Tasks
- T001: Create Docker Compose setup for the entire stack (90% Complete)
- T002: Fix process management in toolkit service (100% Complete)
- T003: Enhance error handling in installation scripts (To Do)
- T004: Implement unified logging system (To Do)
- T005: Create core documentation files (In Progress, 20%)

### Files Modified
- Created `docker-run.ps1` script for Windows PowerShell support
- Fixed `toolkit/toolkit-service.py` with robust process management
- Updated README.md with instructions for Windows users
- Updated STATE.md and TASK.md to reflect current progress

### Recent Decisions and Changes
- Fixed process management in toolkit service by implementing:
  - Proper process tracking with threading and locks
  - Robust process termination with kill trees
  - Child process tracking and cleanup
- Added Windows support for Docker containerization
- Updated documentation to reflect these changes

### Next Steps
1. Test Docker configuration on Linux environment
2. Test Docker configuration on Windows/WSL environment
3. Address any issues found during testing
4. Begin work on error handling improvements (T003)
5. Continue developing core documentation files (T005)

### Questions and Clarifications Needed
- Need to confirm Docker setup works correctly on both Windows and Linux
- May need to adjust container configurations based on testing results

### Session Summary
In this session, we successfully implemented Windows support for the Docker containerization setup by creating a PowerShell script (`docker-run.ps1`). We also fixed the process management issues in the toolkit service by implementing robust process tracking and termination mechanisms, ensuring that no processes are left hanging after scans complete or are cancelled. Documentation was updated to reflect these changes. The containerization implementation is now 90% complete and process management improvements are 100% complete.
