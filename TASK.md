## Current Sprint: Infrastructure and Reliability

Focus areas:
- Containerization
- Process management
- Error handling
- Documentation structure
- Documentation standardization
- Task breakdown into subtasks

## Known Blockers
- Need to test Docker configuration on both Linux and Windows environments
- Need to determine if all required tools work correctly in Docker environment
