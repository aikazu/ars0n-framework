## Checkpoint: CP002 - Docker Containerization Implementation

### Active Branches and Commits
- Main branch - Latest commit: Implementation of Docker containerization files

### Current Implementation Status

#### Core Components
- [x] Client (React frontend)
- [x] Server (Node.js backend)
- [x] Toolkit (Python scanning services)
- [x] MongoDB database

#### Docker Implementation
- [x] docker-compose.yml created
- [x] Dockerfile for client component
- [x] Dockerfile for server component
- [x] Dockerfile for toolkit component
- [x] nginx.conf for client routing
- [x] requirements.txt for toolkit Python dependencies
- [x] docker-run.sh script for Linux/MacOS container management
- [x] docker-run.ps1 script for Windows container management
- [ ] Testing of Docker setup on Linux
- [ ] Testing of Docker setup on Windows/WSL
- [x] Documentation for Docker usage

#### Infrastructure
- [90%] Containerization (T001)
- [100%] Process management improvement (T002)
- [0%] Error handling enhancement (T003)
- [0%] Unified logging system (T004)
- [20%] Core documentation (T005)

### Known Issues or Bugs
1. Docker configuration has not been tested yet
2. May need to adjust toolkit Dockerfile to ensure all required tools are properly installed
3. Client-server communication may need adjustments in containerized environment
4. MongoDB persistence needs testing in Docker setup

### Environment Configuration
- Docker and Docker Compose required for containerized setup
- Original installation script (install.sh/install.py) still required for non-containerized setup
- API keys still need to be configured in ~/.keys directory

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Test Docker configuration on Linux environment
2. Test Docker configuration on Windows/WSL environment
3. Address any issues found during testing
4. Document Docker setup process in README.md
5. Begin work on process management improvements (T002)

### Special Notes
- Docker implementation designed to make deployment easier and more consistent
- Toolkit container based on Kali Linux for tool compatibility
- MongoDB data persisted via Docker volume
